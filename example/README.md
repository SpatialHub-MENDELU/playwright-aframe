# Showcase project

This folder contains a simple application designed to test the Playwright A-Frame library. The application includes 3D models and assets to facilitate testing and experimentation with A-Frame and Playwright.

## Contents

- **3D Models**: The `public/` directory contains `.glb` files representing 3D objects such as trash bags, bottles, paper, bananas, and more. These models are used in the application for testing purposes. License information is below
- **Project source**: The `src/` directory contains the source code for the application
- **Playwright Configuration**: The `playwright.config.ts` file contains the configuration for running Playwright tests
- **Tests**: The `tests/` directory includes test specifications written to validate the functionality of the application

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory
2. Run Playwright tests using the command `npm run test:e2e`
